International Student Mental Health Analysis
Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between an international student's length of stay in a different country and their mental health outcomes. Based on data collected from a Japanese international university, we analyze whether findings align with previous research suggesting international students face higher risks of mental health difficulties.
Research Background
A 2019 study found that international students have higher risks of mental health difficulties compared to the general population. The study identified two key predictors of depression among international students:

Social connectedness (belonging to a social group)
Acculturative stress (stress associated with joining a new culture)

Data Analysis Focus
Our analysis specifically examines whether the length of stay impacts the average mental health diagnostic scores of international students, potentially contributing to the understanding of factors affecting mental health in this population.
Data Description
The dataset students contains survey results from international students, including:

Length of stay (stay)
Mental health diagnostic scores:

PHQ-9 test (todep) - measures depression symptoms
SCS test (tosc) - measures social connectedness
ASISS test (toas) - measures acculturative stress



Analysis Approach
The analysis will examine the relationship between length of stay and mental health metrics specifically for international students. We'll aggregate and summarize the data to identify patterns and potential correlations.
Expected Output
A table with nine rows and five columns:

stay: Length of student's stay
count_int: Number of international students for each length of stay
average_phq: Average PHQ-9 score (depression symptoms)
average_scs: Average SCS score (social connectedness)
average_as: Average ASISS score (acculturative stress)

Interpretation Guidelines

Higher PHQ-9 scores indicate more severe depression symptoms
Higher SCS scores indicate better social connectedness (protective factor)
Higher ASISS scores indicate higher acculturative stress (risk factor)

Ethical Considerations
The original study was approved by ethical and regulatory boards, ensuring the data was collected with proper consent and privacy considerations.
Next Steps
After obtaining the results, compare trends between length of stay and mental health metrics to determine if longer stays correlate with better adaptation (improved mental health scores) or if other patterns emerge.
